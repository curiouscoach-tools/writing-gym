They persist across iterations and get injected into the AI assessment prompt as [Writer's context: \"...\"] annotations so the AI factors them into scoring. Touched 7 files: useSession hook (state + saveCriterionNote action + API payload), prop threading through App → Workspace → HistoryPanel → IterationCard, new CriterionNote component in AssessmentComparison with Add context / Edit / Save+Cancel UI (slate-colored, visually distinct from AI reasoning), and assess-draft API endpoint to weave notes into the criteria list sent to Claude."

AssessmentComparison has two rendering modes: CalibrationView (iteration 1, self vs AI with DeltaIndicator) and ProgressView (iterations 2+, AI scores with ProgressIndicator showing green/red/gray deltas from previous iteration). Changed 5 files: useSession.js (extracted fetchAiAssessment helper, async submitDraft), assess-draft.js (previousAssessment in prompt), IterationCard.jsx (conditional self-assess gating), HistoryPanel.jsx (previousAiScores computation), AssessmentComparison.jsx (CalibrationView + ProgressView split)."
